### Guidelines for PROJECT_TRACKING

#### AFTER_FEATURE_COMPLETION

**IMPORTANT**: After completing any feature, module, or significant implementation:

1. Update `.ai/project-tracker.md` immediately
2. Mark completed features with ✅ status in the relevant phase table
3. Update progress percentages for the relevant phase (e.g., "50% (9/18)" → "56% (10/18)")
4. Update the overall MVP progress overview at the top of the file
5. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp to the current date
6. Ensure phase progress bars are visually accurate

**Examples of when to update:**
- After implementing a new module (e.g., DoneModule, AuthModule)
- After completing a significant feature (e.g., OAuth integration, pagination)
- After setting up infrastructure (e.g., linting, CI/CD, logging)
- After implementing a major component (e.g., AppShell, PlanMode layout)

**What to update:**
- Feature status: ⚪ → 🟡 (in progress) → ✅ (completed)
- Phase progress: Update count and percentage
- Overall MVP progress: Update total count and percentage
- Timestamp: Update "Last Updated" field

This ensures:
- Visibility into project status for all contributors
- Accurate tracking of completion toward MVP goals
- Historical record of when features were completed
- Clear communication of what's done and what's remaining

### Guidelines for DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION

#### VIEW_IMPLEMENTATION_PLANS

**Location**: `.ai/plans/` directory

**File Naming**: `{view-name}-view-implementation-plan.md`

**Examples:**
- `.ai/plans/app-shell-view-implementation-plan.md`
- `.ai/plans/plan-mode-view-implementation-plan.md`
- `.ai/plans/work-mode-view-implementation-plan.md`

**Purpose**: Detailed blueprints for implementing frontend views

#### PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION

**Location**: `.ai/` root directory

**Files Include:**
- `prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `tech-stack.md` - Technology stack overview
- `mvp-ui-architecture-summary.md` - UI architecture decisions
- `project-tracker.md` - MVP progress tracking
- Other project-wide documentation

**Important**: Keep view implementation plans separate in `.ai/plans/` to maintain clear organization between project-level docs and view-specific implementation details
