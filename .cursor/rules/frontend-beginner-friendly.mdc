# Frontend Implementation Rules for Beginners

## Core Principles

**Support Level: BEGINNER-FRIENDLY**
- Keep code in small, understandable chunks (prefer multiple simple components over one complex component)
- Always favor simpler solutions over clever or optimized ones
- Omit nice-to-have features; implement only what's strictly necessary for MVP
- When in doubt, ask for clarification before implementing
- Document unclear decisions in a tracker file for future discussion

## Code Organization

**Component Size**:
- Maximum 50-80 lines per component (excluding types)
- If a component grows larger, split it into smaller components
- Each component should have a single, clear responsibility

**File Structure**:
- One component per file (no multiple exports)
- Keep related files together in feature folders
- Use clear, descriptive file names matching component names

**Naming Conventions**:
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `TaskCard.tsx`)
- Files: Match component name (e.g., `TaskCard.tsx` for `TaskCard` component)
- Hooks: `use` prefix (e.g., `useTaskList.ts`)
- Types: `types.ts` suffix for separate type files

## React Best Practices

**Component Patterns**:
- Use functional components only (no class components)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props (defined at top of file)
- Keep useState and useEffect at the top of components
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks

**State Management**:
- Start with local useState for UI state
- Use TanStack Query only for server data
- Avoid premature optimization with context or complex state

**Props**:
- Keep props simple and flat (avoid nested objects when possible)
- Use explicit prop types (no `any` or overly complex unions)
- Provide default values for optional props

## Styling

**Tailwind CSS**:
- Use utility classes directly in JSX (no @apply in MVP)
- Keep class lists readable (use clsx or cn helper for conditional classes)
- Use shadcn/ui components as-is (no customization in MVP)

**Avoid Premature Styling**:
- Focus on functionality first, polish later
- Use basic Tailwind spacing and colors initially
- Don't spend time on animations or transitions in MVP

## Error Handling

**Keep It Simple**:
- Use try-catch for async operations
- Display simple error messages (no toast libraries in MVP)
- Log errors to console for debugging
- Don't implement complex error recovery in MVP

## Testing (Post-MVP)

**For MVP**:
- Manual testing in browser is sufficient
- Focus on functionality over test coverage
- Add tests after MVP is working

## When to Ask for Help

**Always ask before**:
- Implementing a feature that seems too complex
- Adding a new library or dependency
- Deviating from existing patterns
- Making architectural decisions

**Track for later**:
- Nice-to-have features
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced error handling
- Accessibility enhancements (beyond basic semantic HTML)

## MVP Feature Omissions

The following can be omitted or simplified for MVP:

**Omit**:
- Loading skeletons (use simple spinner)
- Optimistic updates (update after server confirms)
- Complex animations
- Advanced keyboard navigation (implement basic first)
- Accessibility beyond semantic HTML and ARIA basics

**Simplify**:
- Error messages (generic messages OK)
- Validation (basic client-side validation only)
- Empty states (simple text message OK)
- Mobile responsiveness (focus on desktop first, basic mobile later)

## Code Review Checklist

Before submitting code, verify:
- [ ] Component is under 80 lines
- [ ] No complex nested ternaries
- [ ] Props have explicit types
- [ ] No `any` types used
- [ ] Error cases handled with try-catch
- [ ] Component has single responsibility
- [ ] File follows naming conventions
- [ ] Uses existing patterns from codebase
