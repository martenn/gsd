I'm thinking about an app, that will be a variation of getting things done. Imagine multiple backlogs, that can be managed separately, for example: garden, work, house, diy, other, default and so on. Then you just pick tasks from each backlog and put into a week list (something like a sprint scope) - nice for weekly planning. Then you can pick tasks from the week list and put into a today list (something like a daily task list). You can always arrange tasks on the list, the most important tasks are at the top. You can name each backlog, and of course each task. I can imagine also a kind of work mode - you have bolded task, the one which is on top of the today list and you see a forecast (like next 2-3 tasks from the same list). In working mode you can only confirm that task is completed, which will move it to the 'done' list. I can imagine that 'done' list is not visible by default, but you can explore it in a separate view or expanding the 'today' view. I can imagine that you can have a task that is not on the today list, but you can still mark it as completed (that would be handy for delegated tasks).
So, we have work mode and plan mode. In plan mode you can really change everything, you can add new tasks, change existing tasks, delete tasks. You can also change the order of tasks. All should be just easy and simple.

Additional functionality:
- register user
- login
- logout
- change password
- view only own tasks
</functional>

<non-functional>
Non functional requirements:
- Regarding UI, all can be done as a draggable tiles, except marking tasks as completed.
- web app, visible in browser on mobile and desktop (responsive web app)
- deployable to cloud provider
- tasks aren't shared between users
</non-functional>

<open-points>
Open points and questions:
- which cloud provider to use, including tech requirements? It has to be cheap and easy to deploy.
- which tech stack fits the requirements and is easy to deploy?
- Avoid big and complex providers, like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc. They are too complex and hard to deploy. I'd rather use something simple, like DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify.
- Tech stack should be as simple as possible, so that it's easy to deploy. I can go with React + Astro only, if backend stuff will be covered with that, I can go with React + NestJS
- I know a bit of React, I don't know Astro (but if necessary I can learn it), I know NestJS, I know TypeScript, I can dockerize
- Auth need to be included. I would prefer google as the only solution, as then I don't need to manage e-mails and passwords.
- Exposing API from backend will need https.
- I'm familiar with postgres, but maybe we can store the data in a different database. It just need to be easy to deploy and reachable from the backend.

- Cloud provider: Frontend on Cloudflare Pages or Vercel for zero-config static hosting and preview deployments. Backend (if used) on Fly.io (Docker) or Railway/Render. Database on Neon Postgres or Supabase. All are cheap, simple, and GitHub-native.
- Tech stack: Per `/.ai/stack-proposal.mdc` use React + Astro + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui on the frontend and NestJS + TypeScript + TypeORM + PostgreSQL on the backend. Prefer REST for simplicity.
- Provider avoidance: This setup avoids AWS/GCP/Azure while remaining production-ready and easy to deploy.
- Simplest no-backend path: Astro + React on Cloudflare Pages + Supabase (Auth + Postgres). Enforce "view only own tasks" with Row Level Security; optional Edge Functions for server code.
- NestJS option (familiarity): Run NestJS on Fly.io with Docker. Connect to Neon/Supabase Postgres. Use Passport JWT for auth; CORS configured for the Astro/React frontend (Cloudflare/Vercel).
- Minimal tech requirements:
  - Backend: Dockerfile, healthcheck, env vars (`DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, CORS origins), TypeORM migrations, CI to Fly.io.
  - Frontend: Astro static build, deploy via Cloudflare/Vercel; env for API base URL.
  - Database: Neon/Supabase project; enable RLS if using Supabase.
- Auth (Google-only): Use Supabase Auth with only Google enabled to avoid password handling; or with NestJS, Passport Google OAuth 2.0 issuing JWT/refresh tokens.
- HTTPS for backend: Fly.io/Render/Railway provide automatic TLS; add custom domain + HSTS and enforce HTTPS redirect. Configure CORS for https origins.
- Database alternatives: Default Postgres (Neon/Supabase). If switching, consider Turso (SQLite) or PlanetScale (MySQL). Use Prisma for cross-DB support; otherwise stay with Postgres + TypeORM.

## Revised Feasibility Analysis

Given updated constraints (Google-only auth, avoid complex providers, simplicity priority, NestJS familiarity), two viable paths:

### Path A: Serverless (Recommended for Simplicity) ⭐
**Stack**: React SPA + Supabase (Auth + DB)

**Architecture**:
- Frontend: React (Vite) + Tailwind + shadcn/ui on Vercel (free)
- Backend: Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Row Level Security)
- No Astro needed (unfamiliar), no NestJS needed (Supabase handles backend)

**Deployment**:
- Vercel: Push to GitHub → auto-deploy (HTTPS included)
- Supabase: One-click project creation, enable Google OAuth

**Cost**: Free up to 500MB DB, then $25/month
**Complexity**: Low - no backend code, no Docker, no server management

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Simplest path, leverages Supabase RLS for data isolation
- ❌ Need to learn Supabase client SDK and Row Level Security policies (2-3 days)

---

### Path B: Traditional (Leverage NestJS Knowledge)
**Stack**: React SPA + NestJS + Neon Postgres

**Architecture**:
- Frontend: React (Vite) on Vercel (free)
- Backend: NestJS on Fly.io with Docker (~$5/month)
- Database: Neon Postgres (free tier 0.5GB, then $19/month)
- Auth: Passport.js Google OAuth → JWT

**Deployment**:
- Vercel: GitHub auto-deploy
- Fly.io: `fly launch` with Dockerfile
- Neon: Connection string via env var

**Cost**: Free tier possible, ~$5-25/month production
**Complexity**: Medium - backend deployment, env management, CORS setup

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Full control, uses NestJS expertise, no new frameworks
- ❌ More moving parts (backend + DB separately managed)

---

### Recommendation: Path A (Supabase)

**Why**: Aligns with "as simple as possible" requirement. Avoids:
- Backend deployment complexity
- HTTPS/CORS configuration
- JWT token management
- Database hosting separately
- Learning Astro (skip it entirely)

**Learning curve**: 2-3 days for Supabase basics vs. 1 week setting up NestJS + Fly.io + Neon properly.

**Timeline Estimates**:
- Path A: MVP in 2-3 weeks, full feature set in 4-5 weeks
- Path B: MVP in 3-4 weeks, full feature set in 5-7 weeks
