# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - GSD (Getting shit done)
## 1. Product Overview
GSD (Getting shit done) is a focused personal productivity app inspired by GTD that helps solo users plan and execute work using multiple user-managed backlogs (the leftmost step), user-named intermediate lists (e.g., Week, Today), and a focused work mode. Users plan in plan mode (managing lists, tasks, and ordering) and execute in work mode (single-task focus with a short forecast), completing tasks which move to a separate Done archive. The MVP targets responsive web only, single-user accounts, with Google sign-in.

Objectives:
- Provide a simple, keyboard-first workflow for planning and doing work.
- Support multiple independent backlogs (e.g., garden, work, house) and a simple flow from backlogs (leftmost step) → intermediate lists (e.g., Week, Today) → Done.
- Encourage completion by focusing the user on the rightmost active list (typically today) and measuring tasks completed per day/week.

Target users:
- Solo users working in a managed way who want multiple backlogs and a lightweight weekly/daily planning cadence. Collaboration is out of scope for MVP.

Platforms:
- Responsive web app (desktop and mobile web). Online-only for MVP (no offline/PWA).

Assumptions and constraints:
- Single-user accounts only; delegation is modeled via separate backlogs.
- Keyboard-first interaction; no drag-and-drop in MVP.
- Limits: up to 10 non-Done lists and up to 100 tasks per list.

## 2. User Problem
Users with many areas of responsibility need a simple way to:
- Capture and organize tasks per area using named backlogs.
- Plan weekly and daily scopes without heavy project management overhead.
- Maintain a clear execution focus on the next task while knowing what follows.
- Track completed work over time to maintain momentum.

Existing tools are either too heavy (project management suites) or too lightweight (simple checklists without planning structure). Users need a streamlined, opinionated flow with multiple backlogs, a weekly plan, a daily focus list, and a distraction-free work mode.

## 3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Lists and Board
- Users can create, rename, delete, and reorder lists.
- List types: backlog, intermediate, done.
  - Users can mark/unmark any non-Done list as a backlog.
  - Done is special and hidden from the main board.
- Backlogs are always leftmost and may be visually grouped as a leftmost zone; users may have multiple backlogs.
  - Backlogs can be renamed and deleted (subject to at least-one-backlog constraint).
  - Backlogs are organized top-to-bottom to emphasize they are a single origin step (no inherent cross-backlog priority implied by vertical order).
- Flow is left-to-right: backlogs → intermediate lists (e.g., Week, Today) → Done.
- At least one backlog must always exist.
  - If deleting a backlog would result in zero backlogs, the system promotes the leftmost intermediate list to a backlog automatically; if no intermediate exists, deletion is blocked.
- Onboarding creates one Backlog, one intermediate list named Today (renamable/deletable), and Done.
  - Today is an intermediate by default and can be named in any way.
  - A list promoted to backlog cannot be deleted if it is the last remaining backlog.
- The active work list is the rightmost non-Done list (can be a backlog or an intermediate list).
  - If only backlogs exist (no intermediate lists), the rightmost backlog becomes the active list for work mode.
- Backlog/list selection UI in headers includes a searchable dropdown; remembers last used.
- Visual origin: the system assigns each backlog a color; tasks inherit origin color for MVP.

3.2 Tasks
- A task belongs to exactly one list at a time.
- Users can create tasks in any non-Done list, move tasks between lists, reorder tasks within a list, and complete tasks from any list.
- Completing a task moves it to Done and sets completed_at.
- New tasks and tasks moved into a list are inserted at the top of the target list.
- Fields (MVP): title (required), description (optional), list_id, created_at, completed_at (nullable), order_index (strategy TBD). Color derives from the task’s origin backlog color.

3.3 Plan Mode
- Full task and list management: create/rename/delete/reorder lists; create/edit/delete tasks; move tasks across lists; reorder within a list.
- Keyboard-first navigation: arrow keys primary; vim-style h/j/k/l alternates.
- Selection behaves like spreadsheet cells for navigation where relevant.
- “?” shortcut opens keyboard help overlay.
- Controls that would exceed limits (lists >10, tasks per list >100) are disabled.

3.4 Work Mode
- Focused execution view that shows:
  - The top task of the active work list (rightmost non-Done; backlog or intermediate) as the bolded current task.
  - A short forecast of the next 2–3 tasks in that same list.
- Only core action is to mark the current task complete, which moves it to Done and advances the next task.

3.5 Done View
- Separate read-only page with pagination (50 items per page).
- Retention: keep the last N completed tasks and delete oldest first (N=500 for MVP unless configured otherwise later).
- Display completion timestamps (stored in UTC, rendered in the user’s local timezone; week starts Monday).

3.6 Data and Limits
- Lists: up to 10 non-Done lists.
- Tasks: up to 100 tasks per list.
- Consider performance for lists near limits; virtualization can be added if needed.

3.7 Authentication and Account
- Google OAuth sign-in; include sign-out.
- Single-tenant user data: users can only view and manage their own tasks/lists.
- Hard delete for lists/tasks in MVP.
- Account deletion and minimal data export planned (post-MVP if needed).
- Minimal legal pages (privacy, terms) accessible.

3.8 Metrics
- Track counts of tasks completed per user per day and per week.
- Store timestamps in UTC; present in browser timezone; week starts Monday.
- Goal: encourage 10+ tasks completed per user per week.

3.9 Error Handling and UX
- When limits are reached, related controls/keys are disabled. No toasts or complex UX in MVP.
- Basic failure handling: show inline errors where an action fails (e.g., save failed) without elaborate flows.

3.10 Mobile UX
- Show one list at a time with horizontal navigation (swipe left/right); backlog selected from dropdown or similar.
- Work mode is full-screen focus with only the Complete action and navigation actions (back to plan/done).

## 4. Product Boundaries
In scope (MVP):
- Multiple user-managed lists (backlogs and intermediate lists) with CRUD and manual reordering; users can mark/unmark lists as backlogs.
- Today list as a normal list created by default (deletable); Done list is special and hidden on board.
- Plan mode (full control) and work mode (focused complete-only action with forecast).
- Keyboard-first interaction; arrow keys and h/j/k/l; “?” help overlay.
- Dump mode for quick multi-line task creation into default backlog (max 10 lines; remove blanks; allow duplicates).
- Google OAuth, sign-out, and single-user data isolation.
- Done view with pagination and retention N=500.
- Metrics based on completed_at, local timezone presentation, week starting Monday.

Out of scope (MVP):
- Collaboration, shared lists, or multi-user boards.
- Drag-and-drop interactions.
- Offline/PWA and push notifications.
- Rich reminders, due dates, or calendar sync.
- Complex error handling, advanced onboarding, or coaching UX.

Open questions / post-MVP considerations:
- Order indexing strategy (fractional vs stepped integers) and any reindexing plan.
- Final keyboard map and discoverability details of the help overlay.
- Backlog color palette specifics and persistence rules.
- Error handling beyond disabled controls (optimistic updates, retries).
- Mobile gesture refinements (long press, toolbar design).
 - How to indicate/select the active list clearly when only backlogs and Done exist (no intermediate lists).

## 5. User Stories
US-001 Create list
- Description: As a signed-in user, I can create a new list/backlog with a custom name so I can organize tasks by area.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Given I am authenticated, when I click Create List and enter a name, then a new non-Done list appears on the board at the leftmost position (or appended per current order rules) with the entered name and an assigned color.
  - The system prevents creation if there are already 10 non-Done lists (control disabled).

US-002 Rename list
- Description: As a user, I can rename an existing list to maintain clarity as needs evolve.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Given any non-Done list, when I edit its name and save, then the new name is persisted and visible across views.

US-003 Delete list with destination selection
- Description: As a user, I can delete a list and must choose a destination list for its tasks so no tasks are lost.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - When deleting a non-Done list, I am required to choose a destination list (defaulting to the default backlog).
